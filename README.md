## P/s:

Vietnamese: Mất thời gian với cái voice `voiceAdapterCreator`, vì trước giờ mình sài discord seftbot ver 11 là nhiều vì nó rất tiện nhưng vì api có khả năng bị khai tử nên nâng cấp lên ver 13 rất cảm ơn bạn aiko-chan-ai đã làm ra cái repo để mình tiện hơn trong việc làm tool :> cũng mong các bạn chia sẻ cho nhau sài, không đem đi bán, nếu các bạn có người bán thì mình sẽ delete cái repo và drop, tất nhiên nếu các bạn không làm thế thì mình sẽ cập nhập thường xuyên nếu thích hãy để lại 1 star :>.

English: Lost time with the voice `voiceAdapterCreator`, because before I used discord seftbot ver 11 a lot because it is very convenient but because the api is likely to be dead, upgrade to ver 13, thank you aiko-chan-ai make a repo to make it easier for me to make tools :> also hope you guys share it, don't sell it, if you have a seller, i will delete the repo and drop, of course if you don't If you do that, I will update often if you like, please leave a star :>.
